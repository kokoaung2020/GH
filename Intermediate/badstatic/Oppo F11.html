<h1 align="center">About Oppo F11</h1>
<p>
      The phone display notch popularized by Apple's iPhone X has divided 
the house in terms of those who love the design and those who hate it.
That is why Chinese phone makers, led by Vivo, introduced a motorized
pop-up front camera, a groundbreaking smartphone design that's part of a 
collective effort to remove the need for a screen notch.
</p><br>
<p>
     A few months after the launch of the Vivo NEX last year, OPPO hopped
on the pop-up selfie camera bandwagon with the F11 Pro's debut (although 
thestandard model has a waterdrop notch). During my first week of using 
the device, I found this mid-ranger to be an all-around smartphone for 
almost all of what I need from a smartphone.Also, it's easy to recommend 
to my friends for its beautiful design, immersive screen, and great 
camera capabilities. However, are these enough to say you'll get a lot of
bang for your buck?
</p><br>

<h3>Space</h3>
<p>
   The model I'm reviewing comes with 128GB of internal storage, although
this variant arrived only a few months after the phone's initial launch 
in a 6GB/64GB configuration. Nonetheless, its storage is expandable up to
256GB with a microSD card slot.Across the board, the F11 Pro packs some 
significant upgrades from its predecessor, the F9 Pro, except for the 
screen resolution, GPU, and video capabilities, which all have carried 
over from the older handset into the newer one. It's worth mentioning as 
well that aside from the Thunder Black model being reviewed here, the 
phone also comes in Aurora Green and Waterfall Gray options.
</p>
<img src="img/2 Oppo F11.jpg" width="300px" height="200px">
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>
    The F11 Pro has, perhaps, one of the most fascinating designs among 
this year's smartphones. Although it was Huawei that pioneered the 
gradient color design with the P20 series, OPPO almost claimed the title 
with the mesmerizing look of the F11 Pro Black Thunder model.
</p><br>
<p>
   On first look, the phone seems to be made of glass, but its back is 
actually a polycarbonate material with a glossy finish and a metallic 
frame. The triple-gradient color is a mix of deep blue, black, and purple
, giving it a premium feel. Plus, the phone is comfortable to hold in the
 hands courtesy of its rounded corners and tapered sides with a matte 
 finish, which helps to prevent the device from slipping.
</p><br>
<p>
   The alignment of the dual camera module, flash, fingerprint scanner, 
and the OPPO logo with the "Designed by OPPO" phrase next to it all give 
its back some kind of symmetry. However, the slightly large camera bump can't help but cause the phone to wobble when placed on a flat surface.
The volume rocker and power button are conveniently placed in the middle 
of the left and right sides, respectively, so that it's easy to reach 
them with your thumb and fingers when holding the phone with one hand. 
The green accent on the power button is worth noting as well even if only
for its added aesthetics. Other than that, it's got no other function. 
Above the power button is the hybrid dual SIM card tray which can also 
accommodate a micro SD card for expanded storage.At the top of the phone 
sits the pop-up selfie camera, and the noise-canceling microphone next to
it. However, the device utilizes a micro-USB port at the bottom instead 
of USB Type-C, a seemingly backward step for a phone with many modern 
elements all over it. Thankfully, that did not prevent the phone from 
including support for fast charging. Also, you get a 3.5mm headphone 
jack and a single bottom-firing, mono loudspeaker flanking the charging 
port.
</p>

<h3>Display and media capability</h3>
<p>
The display is a head-turner as well. It's got a 90.9% screen-to-body 
ratio, according to OPPO, thanks in large part to the nearly bezel-less 
screen achieved through the pop-up front camera instead of a notch. The 
chin takes up more space than the top bezel, though.Nevertheless, the 
display gives you a good viewing experience when watching YouTube videos 
or Netflix in landscape mode. The display is also great for gaming, with 
highly detailed graphics. In general, it's an immersive screen for all 
your media consumption, meaning you don't get interrupted by a notch or a
camera cutout.Don't expect true blacks from the phone's display, however,
since it's only IPS LCD.
</p><br>
<p>
      But that's not really a deal-breaker. On the other hand, there are 
other several things to appreciate about the screen including the 
accurate colors and decent contrast. In terms of screen brightness, the 
F11 Pro's display is not the brightest out there, but its legibility 
isn't compromised even under direct sunlight.The audio from the 
loudspeaker may not be on a par with other phones equipped with Dolby
Atmos support, so listening to music or video through the loudspeaker can
be a bit underwhelming compared to its higher-end rivals. But for its 
mid-range price, you can cut it some slack. That's not to say the 
listening experience isn't great, it does the job just the same.
</p>

<h3>Performance and battery</h3>
<p>
    The F11 Pro is powered by a Helio P70 SoC, a standard chipset for a 
mid-range device. The processor is paired with 6GB of RAM. It 
incorporates the Arm Cortex-A73/A53 octa-core CPU complex coupled with an
Arm Mali-G72 GPU.OPPO may not be aggressive in terms of marketing the 
phone as something that packs some power, and the phone's benchmark 
scores are not that impressive, either. For context, here are the 
Geekbench results for its CPU performance, with a multi-core score of 5,
600 and a single-core score of 1,555:
</p><br>
<p>
    Finally, the AnTuTu results provide insights into the phone's overall
CPU and GPU performance.
